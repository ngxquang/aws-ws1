1. Optimizing SQL in MySQL  
In a large database system, **optimizing SQL queries** plays a crucial role in improving performance. Each query is not just about searching and retrieving data but is a complex process that affects the overall speed of the system.

2. Why is optimization necessary?  
In practice, as the database grows larger, SQL queries can become slow and consume more resources. Therefore, query optimization is essential to avoid overloading the system and to improve response speed.

This section will discuss how MySQL executes queries and apply optimization techniques such as using **indexes** or **partitioning**.
